## What is Network Canvas?

### Large amounts of digital trace data are now available to human behaviour researchers, but without contextual factors these 'big data' do not necessarily bring greater understanding.

The Network Canvas suite of tools addresses the problem of missing contextual factors in social big data by enabling rich data capture directly from study participants. Supporting all steps in the research process from study design, to data capture and final analysis, Network Canvas allows researchers to capture and analyse personal network data while taking into account the micro and macro structural contexts of human behaviour that are not necessarily included in 'traditional' social big data.


## From the lab to the field â€” and back

### Architect

Network Canvas ArchitectNetwork Canvas Interview App Network Canvas Server
Design an interview protocol, choosing from a selection of common task-oriented interfaces such as name generators and name interpreters. Customise the text of your questions, the variables that capture your responses, and the interview skip logic.

### Network Canvas

In the field, deploy your interview protocol on the Network Canvas app, running on tablet or desktop form-factors. Take advantage of the convinience and simplicity of a digital data capture instrument.

### Server

Seamlessly and securely receive interview data at your lab. See overview data at a glance, or construct filters and queries for exporting it for additional analysis.

## Extensible and Configurable

The Network Canvas suite is completely open source, making it free for developers or technically minded people who develop or extend the software's functionality. It uses **HTML5** for markup, **JavaScipt** for logic and interaction, and **CSS3** for user interface and design, which means that it is natively fast, flexible, and cross-platform. It also uses several different wrapper technologies which allow it to function on different types of devices and operating systems (such as iOS, Android, Windows, Linux, and OSX).

These technologies also allow researchers with sufficient technical knowledge to implement custom interview tasks.
