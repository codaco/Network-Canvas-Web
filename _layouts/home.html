        <p>The Network Canvas suite of tools addresses the problem of missing contextual factors in social big data by enabling rich data capture directly from study participants. Supporting all steps in the research process from study design, to data capture and final analysis, Network Canvas allows researchers to capture and analyse personal network data while taking into account the micro and macro structural contexts of human behaviour that are not necessarily included in 'traditional' social big data.</p>
